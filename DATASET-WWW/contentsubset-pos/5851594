A_DT combinatorial_JJ allocation_NN mechanism_NN with_IN penalties_NNS for_IN banner_NN advertising_NN Most_NNP current_JJ banner_NN advertising_NN is_VBZ sold_VBN through_IN negotiation_NN thereby_RB incurring_VBG large_JJ transaction_NN costs_NNS and_CC possibly_RB suboptimal_JJ allocations_NNS ._.
We_PRP propose_VBP a_DT new_JJ automated_JJ system_NN for_IN selling_VBG banner_NN advertising_NN ._.
In_IN this_DT system_NN ,_, each_DT advertiser_NN specifies_VBZ a_DT collection_NN of_IN host_NN webpages_NNS which_WDT are_VBP relevant_JJ to_TO his_PRP$ product_NN ,_, a_DT desired_VBN total_JJ quantity_NN of_IN impressions_NNS on_IN these_DT pages_NNS ,_, and_CC a_DT maximum_JJ per-impression_NN price_NN ._.
The_DT system_NN selects_VBZ a_DT subset_NN of_IN advertisers_NNS as_IN `_`` winners_NNS '_'' and_CC maps_VBZ each_DT winner_NN to_TO a_DT set_NN of_IN impressions_NNS on_IN pages_NNS within_IN his_PRP$ desired_VBN collection_NN ._.
The_DT distinguishing_JJ feature_NN of_IN our_PRP$ system_NN as_IN opposed_VBN to_TO current_JJ combinatorial_JJ allocation_NN mechanisms_NNS is_VBZ that_IN ,_, mimicking_VBG the_DT current_JJ negotiation_NN system_NN ,_, we_PRP guarantee_VBP that_IN winners_NNS receive_VBP at_IN least_JJS as_IN many_JJ advertising_NN opportunities_NNS as_IN they_PRP requested_VBD or_CC else_RB receive_VB ample_JJ compensation_NN in_IN the_DT form_NN of_IN a_DT monetary_JJ payment_NN by_IN the_DT host_NN ._.
Such_JJ guarantees_NNS are_VBP essential_JJ in_IN markets_NNS like_IN banner_NN advertising_NN where_WRB a_DT major_JJ goal_NN of_IN the_DT advertising_NN campaign_NN is_VBZ developing_VBG brand_NN recognition_NN ._.
